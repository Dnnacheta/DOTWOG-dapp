A Decentralized Data Migration Platform

When a website goes down, often it is due to the failure of the centralized service. Sometimes it is a matter of internet. Often it is due to failure of the server. Relatively, this a problem IPFS hopes to solve. A decentralized peer to peer file sharing network. An open source web3 service; complete decentralization..to ensure that the web is fully accessible to all. DOTWOG builds on this idea to give users a decentralized option, where your data is completely owned by you.

How are we doing it?

DOTWOG is a complete decentralized data migration platform where users can move their files from centralized system to decentralized platform. When a file is uploaded on DOTWOG, the file when uploaded successfully is followed with a unique details of the uploaded file, which shows the accessibility of the file on a decentralized model. The IPFS hash generated, which contains information of the file, can then be copied and paste to see the uploaded file on etherscan.
